## What does this app do?

Great question! 

**TLDR:** 

It automatically syncs all of the highlights and notes that you make on the kindle app right to a Notion database at any interval of your choosing! It’s completely free, set it up once and never worry about your notes being out of sync again!

**More Background:**

There are other apps that do this (namely Readwise), but they all charge a monthly subscription charge for this service. For those of us that don’t have this extra money lying around or don’t want to pay monthly for a service that we can code up in a few hours, this seems ridiculous. For anyone checking out this github page, this choice is even easier for you to make since you don’t have to code anything yourself! I’ve already put this together for you, and in about 10 minutes, you can set this service up and save yourself that monthly fee.

**Go from this:**
